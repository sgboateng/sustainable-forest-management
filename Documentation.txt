**** USES OF TECHNOLOGY IN FORESTRY.

Some of the innovative technologies that help to manage forests are as follows.

DRONES.
Drone technology is used to detect pests that affect canopies. This helps to identify the outbreak, and sudden actions can be taken instantly. We can also identify forest fires and 
also locate intense hot spots. Thus avoiding the chances of a disaster and saving many lives. We can also track illegal logging with the help of drone technology. Drones can also be 
used to distribute seed balls at places where human interventions are not possible.

GEOTAGGING.
Geotagging is a method of adding geographical data to various media such as photographs, videos, QR codes, etc. By implementing GeoTagging in forests, an individual tree can then be 
identified with the help of satellites and can even monitor from space. Geo-tagging is usually done to fulfil specific needs such as identifying destroyed trees, preserving the 
national trees, and endangered trees in a particular area.

GREEN BOTS.
These technology-driven intelligent sensors can be vital in preserving forests and providing data to serve as a catalyst towards more sustainable forest management. Green bots are 
also valuable for checking methane leaks, which can deplete root level oxygen and result in the death of a tree. In addition, they monitor real-time activities in areas that are more 
prone to forest fires. This digital inventory helps document the roots, soil types, and climatic conditions for each significant territory.

LIDAR TECHNOLOGY.
(Light Detection and Ranging) is also beneficial for modern foresters, which collects tree measurements and detailed imaging. LIDAR helps measure canopy heights and volume, 
basal areas and habitat mapping.
